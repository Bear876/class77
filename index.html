        <h1>Project Using Console</h1>
        <br>
        <p>To set up Visual Studio Code, you must download and install VS Code, create a new file, see an overview of the user interface, install support for your favorite programming language, change your keyboard shortcuts and easily migrate from other editors using keymap extensions, customize your editor with themes, explore VS Code features in the Interactive Editor Playground. To create a new project, you can createa new folder. If you want to code in html in that folder, you must write index.html. You can write style.css or function.js</p>
        <br>
        <p>We use the console so we can see the output of the code or it can help us debug it. You can print anything on the console by using console.log(). You can put whatever you want to print inside the round brackets. </p>
        <h2>Console Log</h2>
        <script>
            console.log("My first console project!")
            var a="Bella";
            console.log(a);
            var b=" Sah"
            console.log(b);
            var c= a.concat(b);
            console.log(c);
            console.log("3 numbers: 13, 7, 21")
            console.log("Maximum Number")
            var k= Math.max(13,7,21);
            console.log(k);
            console.log("Minimum Number")
            var l= Math.min(13,7,21);
            console.log(l);
            console.log("Addition of all numbers")
            var add= (13+7+21)
            console.log(add)
            console.log("Multiplication of all numbers")
            var multi=(13*7*21)
            console.log(multi)
